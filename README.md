# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Harry, I'm an engineer _(In training)_ who loves to build things.

I use this platform for a lot of things, both big and small, and spanning a wide
range of contexts. From hobby projects, to academic projects, to documents I've
written, to labs I've designed for the York Engineering Society, all of it lives
on this GitHub.
